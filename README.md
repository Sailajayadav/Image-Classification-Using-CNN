# Image Classification using CNN  

## Overview  
This project implements an Image Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system takes an input image, processes it through the CNN model, and classifies it into predefined categories.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of images (resizing, normalization, data augmentation).  
- CNN model for image classification.  
- Training and evaluation on a dataset.  
- Visualization of accuracy and loss metrics.  
- Prediction functionality for new images.  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- A machine with GPU (optional but recommended for faster training).  
- A dataset of images categorized into folders (e.g., `data/train` and `data/test`).  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification-cnn.git
   cd image-classification-cnn
   ```  

2. Install the required Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

## Usage  

### 1. Data Preparation  
Organize your dataset in the following structure:  
```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ class_2/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg
â””â”€â”€ test/
    â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg
    â””â”€â”€ class_2/
        â”œâ”€â”€ img1.jpg
        â”œâ”€â”€ img2.jpg
```

### 2. Training the Model  
Run the training script:  
```bash
python train.py
```  
This will preprocess the data, train the CNN model, and save the trained model to the `models/` directory.  

### 3. Evaluating the Model  
To evaluate the model on the test set, run:  
```bash
python evaluate.py
```  

### 4. Making Predictions  
Use the trained model to classify new images:  
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

â”œâ”€â”€ models/                # Saved models  
â”œâ”€â”€ train.py               # Script for training the model  
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluate.py            # Script for evaluating the model  
â”œâ”€â”€ predict.py             # Script for making predictions  
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py               # Utility functions  
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies

```  

## Model Architecture  
The CNN model consists of the following layers:  
1. Convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.  
2. Fully connected dense layers.  
3. Dropout for regularization.  
4. Softmax activation in the output layer for classification.  

## Results  
- Training Accuracy: XX%  
- Test Accuracy: XX%  
- Loss Graphs: Included in the `plots/` directory.  

## Future Work  
- Add transfer learning using pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).  
- Extend the application to multi-label classification.  
- Optimize the model for deployment using TensorFlow Lite or ONNX.
